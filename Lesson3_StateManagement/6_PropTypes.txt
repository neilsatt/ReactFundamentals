Type checking a Component's Props with PropTypes

 PropTypes is a package that lets us define the data type we want to see right from the get-go and warn us 
 during development if the prop that's passed to the component doesn't match what is expected.
 
 npm install --save prop-types
 
------------------------------------------------------ 
 
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class Email extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h3>Message: {this.props.text}</h3>
    );
  }
}

Email.propTypes = {
  text: // ???  Answer is PropTypes.string.isRequired
};
