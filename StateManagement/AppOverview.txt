A large app is built by building a bunch of smaller components and then composing them together.

The Contact allows us to manage our contacts. 

We have three contacts and search. Typing filters the results. 

You have a reset link ('show all') and a delete icon. 

You can also create a new contact with an avatar, and are taken to a new screen using routing.
