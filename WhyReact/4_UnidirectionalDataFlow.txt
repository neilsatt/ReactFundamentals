In React, the data flows from the parent component to a child component. 

Data updates are sent to the parent component where the parent performs the actual change.

If the data must be updated, then only the parent component should perform the update. 

If the child component needs to make a change to the data, then it would send the updated 
data to the parent component where the change will actually be made. 


Data-flow In React Recap
In React, data flows in only one direction, from parent to child. 

If data is shared between sibling child components, then the data  should be stored 
in the parent component and passed to both of the child components that need it.
