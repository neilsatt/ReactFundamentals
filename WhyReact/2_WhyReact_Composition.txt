React Advantages -----------------------------------------

Compositional Modal

Declarative Nature

The way data flows through a component

React is just Javascript

--------------------------------------------------------

Composition is just combining simple functions together to create complex functions. 

Simple functions:

function getProfileLink (username) {
  return 'https://github.com/' + username
}

function getProfilePic (username) {
  return 'https://github.com/' + username + '.png?size=200'
}

To compose them, we'd just combine them together inside another function:
Returns an object 
function getProfileData (username) {
  return {
    pic: getProfilePic(username),
    link: getProfileLink(username)
  }
}


This is valid JavaScript, but not composition, because it's using two URLs:

function getProfileData (username) {
  return {
    pic: 'https://github.com/' + username + '.png?size=200',
    link: 'https://github.com/' + username
  }
}


getProfileLink – just builds up a string of the user's GitHub profile link
getProfilePic – just builds up a string the user's GitHub profile picture
getProfileData – returns a new object


React makes use of the power of composition. React builds up pieces of a UI using components. 

<Page />
<Article />
<Sidebar />

<Page>
  <Article />
  <Sidebar />
</Page>
Now the Page component has the Article and Sidebar components inside. This is just like the earlier example where getProfileData had getProfileLink and getProfilePic inside it.


Composition occurs when simple functions are combined together to create more complex functions. Think of each function as a single building block that does one thing (DOT). When you combine these simple functions together to form a more complex function, this is composition.
