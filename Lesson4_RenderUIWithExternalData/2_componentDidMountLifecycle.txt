Lifecycle Events are special methods each component can have that allow us
to hook into the views when specific conditions happen. 

render() 
- Is For Rendering only
- Data should not be fetched in the render method
- should not make any HTTP or Ajax requests
- or alter the DOM

render() is only used for receiving props and displaying content, so
we put the code that should handle these things in lifecycle events.

Lifecycle events are automatically bound to the component instance, 
and React calls them at certain times during the life of a component.


componentWillMount()
    - invoked immediately before the component is inserted in the DOM
    

componentDidMount()
    - invoked immediately after the component is inserted into the DOM
    

componentWillUnmount()
    - invoked immediately before a component is removed from the DOM
    
componentWillReceiveProps()
    - invoked whenever the component is about to receive brand new props
    
To use one of these, you'd just create a method in your component with the 
name and React will call it.
